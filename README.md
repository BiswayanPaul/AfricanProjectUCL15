UCL OOP Project 2014/2015

We are developing an Android app that will help spread information about Tuberculosis to young people in rural, 
economically-deprived areas. The application will provide information on the disease, how to combat it, 
and provide medication reminders for people undergoing treatment. 

We will try and present the information in a way that is simple but not trivial.
